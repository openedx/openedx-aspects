There you will see the three principal dashboards of Aspects: the `Course Dashboard <https://docs.openedx.org/projects/openedx-aspects/en/latest/reference/course_overview_dashboard.html>`_, the `Individual Learner Dashboard <https://docs.openedx.org/projects/openedx-aspects/en/latest/reference/individual_learner_dashboard.html>`_, and the `At Risk Learner Dashboard <https://docs.openedx.org/projects/openedx-aspects/en/latest/reference/learner_groups_dashboard.html>`_. From these dashboards, you will see the course and learner information that Aspects has collected.
