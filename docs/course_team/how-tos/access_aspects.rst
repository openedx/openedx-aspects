How to Access Aspects as a Course Delivery Team Member
######################################################

Once the Administrator has assigned you the course delivery team role and permitted you to do so, you will have access to the reports from the LMS by following these simple steps.

1. In the LMS, go to the **Instructor** Tab.

2. Select the **Reports** tab.

There you will see the three principal dashboards of Aspects: the `Course Dashboard <https://docs.openedx.org/projects/openedx-aspects/en/latest/reference/course_overview_dashboard.html>`_, the `Individual Learner Dashboard <https://docs.openedx.org/projects/openedx-aspects/en/latest/reference/individual_learner_dashboard.html>`_, and the `At Risk Learner Dashboard <https://docs.openedx.org/projects/openedx-aspects/en/latest/reference/learner_groups_dashboard.html>`_. From these dashboards, you will see the course and learner information that Aspects has collected.


3. Above the dashboards, you will find a link to access the dashboards from Superset, modify the filters, and download the reports.
