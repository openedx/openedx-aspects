There you will see the three principal dashboards of Aspects: the :doc: `Course Dashboard <course_overview_dashboard>`, the :doc: `At-Risk Learner Dashboard <learner_groups_dashboard>`, and the `Individual Learner Dashboard <individual_learner_dashboard>`. From these dashboards, you will see the course and learner information that Aspects has collected.


#. Above the dashboards, you will find a link to access the dashboards from Superset, modify the filters, and download the reports.
