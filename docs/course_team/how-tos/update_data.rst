Automatic Refresh
*****************

In addition to manually refreshing the dashboard, you can also set up automatic refresh intervals. Superset allows you to set an auto-refresh interval for each dashboard. This way, the dashboards will automatically update themselves at the specified interval. 

1. Select the Set auto-refresh interval option.
