How to Add or Remove a Cross-filter in an Aspects Dashboard
############################################################

Cross-filters are useful for applying the same filter to other charts and tables in the dashboard that use the same dataset. However, cross-filters are not available for all fields. For example, Adding a cross-filter for a single video on the Video Engagement tab of the Course Dashboard filters all applicable video tables and graphs to show only data for that video.

How to Add a Cross-Filter
*************************
1. Right-click any cell, bar, or line graph element on a chart or table in an Aspects dashboard.

2. Select **Add cross-filter**.
