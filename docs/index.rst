Welcome to the Open edX Aspects documentation!
==============================================

Aspects is an analytics system for Open edX, bringing actionable data about course and learner performance to instructors and site operators. It is primarily a Tutor plugin that ties together data from the Open edX learning management system and Studio using open source tools to aggregate and transform learning traces into data visualizations.

As of September 2023 it is in beta and seeking testers, which you can learn about at the `beta wiki page
