In the Course Dashboard Report, you will find all the information related to the course performance, like the number of people who have enrolled, how those people have consumed the course content, such as pages, problems, and videos, and how many people have passed the course.

What Is the Data on this Board?
*******************************

The information on this board is divided into three main blocks.

1. Current Enrollments:
=======================

The first block is in the upper left corner of the dashboard, where you will find the total number of people enrolled in the course.

2. Course Information: 
======================
The second block is on the right side of Current Enrollments. This table concisely overviews key metrics for a specific course or course run. It is divided into several columns, each representing a different aspect of course performance.

- **Organization:** This column indicates the organization to which a particular course is linked. It helps categorize courses and identify which ORG is responsible for them.
- **Course Key:** This column provides a unique identifier for the course, often a combination of letters and numbers. It distinguishes between different versions or iterations of the same course.
- **Course Name:** This column displays the course's title or name. It provides a human-readable label for easy identification.
- **Course Run:** This column specifies a particular instance or version of the course. It allows you to track the performance of different course offerings over time.
- **Active within the Last 7 Days:** This column shows the number of active learners in the course within the last seven days. It indicates current student engagement and activity.
- **Avg Course Grade:** This column displays the average grade achieved by all learners who have completed the course. It offers a measure of overall course performance.
- **Median Course Grade** This column represents the middle value of the course grades. It provides a more robust measure of central tendency compared to the mean, as it is less affected by outliers.
