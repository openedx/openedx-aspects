Individual Learner Dashboard Reports
####################################

The Individual Learner Dashboard Reports focus on relevant information about each learnerâ€™s performance and information, including course enrollment and activity logs, to give a general overview. If the name, username, and email address columns are empty in the learner summary, it is because your site operator has chosen to omit limited personally identifiable information from being displayed on your Open edX instance.

As with the rest of the Aspects dashboards, this dashboard's charts apply cross-filters to charts whose data sets contain the same name. 

One particular benefit of this dashboard is that it gives the course delivery team a general view of the course performance while zooming in and out on each learner, combining the Course Dashboard and At-Risk Learner Dashboard information.
