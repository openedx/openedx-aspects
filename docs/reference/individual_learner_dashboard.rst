Individual Learner Dashboard Reports
####################################

The Individual Learner Dashboard Reports focus on relevant information about each learner’s performance and information, including course enrollment and activity logs, to give a general overview. Suppose the name, username, and email address columns are empty in the learner summary. In that case, your site operator has omitted limited personally identifiable information from being displayed on your Open edX instance. The Individual Learner Dashboard can only be filtered by one or more individual learners if the Operator has chosen to display limited personally identifiable information on your instance. 

One particular benefit of this dashboard is that it gives the course delivery team a general view of the course performance while zooming in and out on each learner, combining the `Course Dashboard <https://docs.openedx.org/projects/openedx-aspects/en/latest/reference/course_overview_dashboard.html>`_ and `At Risk Learner Dashboard <https://docs.openedx.org/projects/openedx-aspects/en/latest/reference/learner_groups_dashboard.html>`_ information. As with the rest of the Aspects dashboards, this dashboard’s charts apply cross-filters to charts whose data sets contain the same name.

This dashboard's data information is divided into two sections: the Learner Summary and the pages, problems, videos, and help reports.

1. Learner Summary
==================

This section has a table that provides a detailed overview of individual learner performance within a specific course or course run. It offers valuable insights into student engagement, progress, and overall performance. The table columns are:

- **Username:** A unique identifier assigned to each learner.
- **Name:** The learner's full name or preferred name.
- **Email:** The learner's email address.
- **Course Name:** The title or name of the course.
- **Course Run:** A specific instance or version of the course.
- **Enrollment Date:** The date when the learner initially enrolled in the course.
- **Last Visited:** The date of the learner's last activity within the course.
- **Passed/Failed:** Indicates whether the learner has completed the course or not.
- **Enrollment Track:** Specifies the type of enrollment (e.g., honor, verified, audit).
- **Enrollment Status:** Indicates the current enrollment status of the learner (e.g., registered, active, inactive).
- **Grade Range:** The possible range of grades for the course.
- **Course Grade %:** The learner's actual percentage grade achieved in the course.
