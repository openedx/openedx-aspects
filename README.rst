# Aspects

Learner analytics for Open edX!

## What is Aspects?

Aspects is an optional implementation of analytics for the Open edX LMS. It is the combined solution of Cairn by Overhang.io and the OARS project developed by Axim Collaborative with a huge amount of help from the Open edX community. Primarily it is intended to be a "batteries included" set of configurations and plugins to combine 3rd party tools into a powerful and flexible system for learner analytics.

## This repository

This repository holds the core Aspects codebase. These include things like the schema management tools for the data warehouse, the Superset assets and configuration scripts, and tools for helping test and deploy Aspects. It also includes the documentation for Aspects that rendered to the [Open edX documentation site](https://docs.openedx.org/projects/openedx-aspects).

## Status

Aspects is in development by efforts from Axim Collaborative and Open edX community contributors. For more information, see:
